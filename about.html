    <h1> About </h1>
    <p> Established in 1996, Coastal Peoples Gallery has brought visitors and
      collectors together to experience a superb collection of fine First Nations
      and Inuit art works. <br>
      <br>
      Celebrating over 20 years of excellence, Coastal Peoples has become
      renowned for its museum-quality works which entice inquisitive
      newcomers as well as seasoned collectors to delve further into this
      fascinating and legendary art form. The Gallery represents master artisans,
      and has earned a reputation for discovering a new generation of gifted talent
      who create beyond the boundaries of the traditional. <br>
      <br>
      For centuries, First Nations peoples have flourished along the westcoast
      of Canada, and the northern Arctic, living amongst spectacular sweeping
      landscapes and mountainous regions. Emerging from this abundant land of natural beauty
      is a diverse group of artisans who captivate us with their mythic stories
      and culturally expressive art works. <br>
      <br>
      The Gallery's collection encompasses both the traditional and contemporary,
      and speaks to the deeply rooted oral traditions of those who handcraft
      these magnificent creations. <br>
      We offer our gratitude to these artists who have dedicated themselves
      to their art and thank them for their passion, creativity and sense
      of pride.
    </p>
